I am a Research Associate at [Laboratory for Computational Social Systems (LCS2), IIIT-Delhi](http://lcs2.iiitd.edu.in/people.html), working on misinformation detection and verification under the supervision of 
[Prof. Tanmoy Chakraborty](http://faculty.iiitd.ac.in/~tanmoy/) in collaboration with Accenture Labs. I am interested in Deep Learning and its applications in Natural Language Processing and related interdisciplinary fields. 

I completed my undergraduation in Software Engineering from [Delhi Technological University](http://dtu.ac.in/) supervised by [Prof. Ruchika Malhotra](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=gQrxcioAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao). In the four years of my undergraduation, I applied AI in the fields of [Computational Neuroscience](project/iitd) (with [Prof. Tapan Gandhi](https://tapankgandhi.com/), IIT Delhi), [surveillance](https://github.com/shivangchopra11/InfyHack), [privacy protection](project/rips/), [software engineering](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9200103) and most recently for fighting misinformation related to COVID-19. I'm deeply fascinated by the power and utility it possesses and aim to bring a change in this world with the help of theoretical and applied Machine Learning, Deep Learning, and Natural Language Processing with a strong inclination towards researching the mathematics behind them.

I am also passionate about communities and aim to create equal opportunities in STEM by promoting diversity and inclusion. I am a [Lead at Women Who Code Delhi](https://www.womenwhocode.com/delhi/about) and founded the community [MLNerdie x Delhi](https://www.mlnerdie.com/chapter/) to bridge the gap between academia and industry in machine learning.

<!-- to work towards the same objective. -->
