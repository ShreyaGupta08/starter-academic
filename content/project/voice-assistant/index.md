In January 2019, I had the opportunity to be in the top 20 teams to be selected for a two day hackathon - Wintathon by LinkedIn.
The hackathon was hosted at their Bangalore office. For the hackathon, we decided to design a voice assistant for LinkedIn.

The code, presentation and demo for the project is available [here](https://github.com/ShreyaGupta08/Voice-Assistant-LinkedIn)

### Learnings
- This project taught me how to implement statistical NLP metrics
- integrate the code while designing an application that is functional
- be realistic while presenting a work in terms of not only the social impact but also on how well a model does what it is supposed to do.
